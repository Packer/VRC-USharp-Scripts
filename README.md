# VRC-USharp-Scripts
Packer's VR Chat Udon Sharp scripts, for all to use in thier own worlds.

### VRC Advanced Pickup
A simple companion script to VRChat's VRCPickup component, it handles a low network traffic cost synchronization of pickups. Rather than continuous synchronizing of a pick up (high bandwidth use), it sends basic position and rotation infomation when picked up to all the clients and handles the rest locally freeing up world bandwidth.

Release: https://github.com/Packer/VRC-USharp-Scripts/releases/
